# HeadphoneAmp by Moshe Stanylov

This is a PCB design project for a compact headphone amplifier.
I've used EAGLE to design a PCB layout and generate Gerber files.
The PCB was fabricated successfully at Bay Area Circuits.
I've soldered and tested the PCB, the amp is functional with a high signal to noise ration.

a more detailed discussion of the design can be found in Design.pdf
